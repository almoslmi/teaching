# Learn Programming with P5.js

*(or, Code, Art, Animation, and Simulation for Newbs)*

These lessons will attempt to teach code via animations in P5.js, taking good chunks from Dan Shiffman's *The Nature of Code* and his *Coding Train* Youtube channel, along with other things that come out of my head about introduction to programming stuff.  This syllabus should be a more-or-less living document that I'll flesh out as I figure out more about how I want to teach and what works and doesn't.
