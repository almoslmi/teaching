# Calculator Project

The goal of this project is for you to create a library that allows people to do simple calculator functions.  Your module will be graded on the following:

 - Functionality: Does it pass all of the tests (see below) - 60%
 - Style: Does it match pep8?  If not, is it at least internally consistent? - 30%
 - Documentation: Are docstrings present?  Is the level of commenting appropriate? - 10%

## Functionality Requirements

 1. Module should be named `calculator.py`
 2. It should provide the following functions:
  - add
  - subtract
  - multiply
  - divide
  - square root
  - compare
  - clear
 3. It should pass all of the tests.  Remember: test using command `py.test`
