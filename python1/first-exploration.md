# First Exploration into Python

The point of this first exploration is to have the students explore Python through the REPL.  I'm going to give them a list of things to type and see what comes out the other side.  I'll end with some thinker questions and answers, and maybe a homework.

## The Code

First, as is tradition when learning a new programming language or technology:

```python
>>> "Hello, world!"
```
For the rest of the exploration, it is encouraged to explore.  If one of the lines doesn't make sense, play around and try different inputs until what's going on makes sense.

Now, let's play with some numbers:
```python
>>> 2 + 2
>>> 5 - 3
>>> 8 * 8
>>> 25/6
>>> 25//6
>>> 25 % 6
>>> 2**5
```

Next, how about some words.
```python
>>> "cool beans"
>>> 'cool beans'
>>> cool beans
>>> 'He said "cool beans!"'
>>> "Not as cool as Jerry's beans"
>>> "cool" + "beans"
>>> "cool" + " beans"
>>> "cool" + " " + "beans"
```

How about some algebra!?
```python
>>> x = 5 + 3
>>> x
>>> x * 2
>>> y
>>> y = x * 2
>>> y
>>> x = 16
>>> y
>>> x = x + 1
>>> x
>>> 2 = 4
>>> a = 1
>>> b = 4
>>> c = 2
>>> x = (-b + (b**2 - 4*a*c)**.5)/(2*a)
>>> x
```

Lastly, just an example that will help us in the future:
```python
>>> 2 + 2
>>> # 2 + 2
>>> x = 5 # + 6
>>> x
>>> # I can write anything I want here to give you a message
>>> # within the code!
>>> #the extra space isn't needed, but it looks nice
```

## Questions to Ponder
1. Did you encounter anything that didn't make sense?
2. What does the = sign do?
3. What does the # sign do?
4. What does the % sign do?
4. Did you encounter any errors?
5. Did the errors tell you anything useful?

## Homework
Use Python (and Google, where needed) to answer the following questions.  Print out your screen and turn it in.

1. Calculate the average density of the planets (Pluto optional)
2. If you were to purchase the top 3 most popular books on Amazon right now, calculate the total price.  Assume the tax rate is 11%.  You can assume you are a Prime customer, so shipping was free.
3. Convert 5138161535 seconds to years, days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
4. You have one fair 6-sided die.  You roll it 4 times.  What are the odds that you roll an even number, then an odd number, then a number bigger than 3, then a two?
