# Syllabus (In Progress)

## Primary Goals
The primary goals of this class are to ignite curiousity in students, to begin building the problem-solving mindset of the coder, and to provide an introduction to the language of Python, in that order.  I am going to do that primarily by starting off showing the students the wonder of programming and getting them interested and excited.  This stage will strive to not use any sort of jargon or deep dives into fundamentals.  Once they are hungering for more, I can start to provide a framework and terminology to help them build more knowledge.
